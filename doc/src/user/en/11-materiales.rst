Administration of materials
===========================

Users can manage a basic database of materials, organised by categories.

The categories are containers that can be assigned specific materials and also more categories.
They are stored in a tree structure as the materials can belong to leaf or intermediary categories.

Users have to do the following to manage categories:

* Go to the "Administration->Materials" option.
* The program shows a tree of categories.
* The user enters a category name in the text box and then clicks "Add".
* The program adds the category to the tree.

If users want to insert a category into the category tree, they have to first select the parent category in the tree and then click "Add".
