Pipeline planning dashboard
###############################

.. contents::

The pipeline planning dashboard is a *LibrePlan* perspective which lists the names of all company projects in a table.
This 'pipeline' table has nine columns each corresponding to a project status:

	* PRE-SALES
	* OFFERED
	* OUTSOURCED
	* ACCEPTED
	* STARTED
	* ON HOLD
	* FINISHED
	* CANCELLED
	* ARCHIVED

Projects are listed by name in each column based on their current status.

A project's start date, end date, and current progress can be viewed in a 'tool tip' popup by hovering the mouse pointer
over a project's name.

Projects with an *ARCHIVED* status can be hidden by unchecking the 'Show archived column data' checkbox.
