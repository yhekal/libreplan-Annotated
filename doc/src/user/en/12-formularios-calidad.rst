Administration of quality forms
===============================

Quality forms consist of a list of questions or sentences that indicate the tasks or processes that should have been
completed so that a task can be marked as complete by the company. These forms consist of the following fields:

* Name
* Description
* Type of quality form. The type can have two values:

   * Percentage: Indicating that the questions must have a logical order and affirmative answers to the questions indicate that the task is progressing. For example, a basic process for a task suggests that the task is 15% complete. Users need to answer a question beforehand to be able to go on to the next one.
   * Item: Indicating that the questions are not required to have a logical order and therefore can be answered as desired.

* Click edit an existing form or "Create".
